# Project X: A Conceptual Programming Language Combining Java, Python, and C#

Project X is an exciting conceptual programming language that aims to blend the best features of Java, Python, and C#. This project is a fun exploration into langauge design, seeking to create a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly programming experience.

## ðŸš€ Key Features (Proposed)

- **Hybrid Typing**: Statically typed with dynamic execution capabilities
- **Intuitive Syntax**: Easy to read and write, suitable for beginners and experts
- **Cross-Platform**: Write once, run anywhere
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized resource usage
- **Fast Execution**: Quick runtime performance despite being interpreted
- **Built-in Security**: Enhanced safety features by default
- **OOP Support**: Full object-oriented programming capabilities

## ðŸ’¡ Conceptual Syntax Example

```
// Variable Declaration
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

// Function Declaration
func greet(name) -> string {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!"
}

// Class declaration
class Person {
  name = ""
  age = 0

  func introduce() -> string {
    return "My name is " + this.name + " and I'm " + str(this.age) + " years old."
  }
}

// Control structures
if x > 0 {
  print("x is positive")
} else {
  print("x is non-positive")
}

for i in range(5) {
  print(i)
}

while x > 0 {
  x = x - 1
}

// Function call
result = greet("Alice")
print(result)

// Object instantiation and method call
person = Person()
person.name = "Bob"
person.age = 30
introduction = person.introduce()
print(introduction) 
```
